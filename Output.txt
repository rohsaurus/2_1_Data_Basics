Would you like to either convert from Faherenheit to Celsisus or Celsius to Fahrenheit. Please type f for faherenheit to
 celsius and type c for celsius to faherheit
f
Enter a Fahrenheit temperature and the system will convert it to Celsius
32
The temperture in Celsius is 0
How many pieces of pizza did you eat?
3
You need to jog for a total distance of 11 miles.
